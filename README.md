| **Firebase Authentication** | To handle secure user login/signup | It provides **ready-to-use authentication**, supports multiple providers (email, Google, etc.), and is simple to integrate without writing backend code. |
| **Firebase Firestore** | To store books, users, and borrow information | Firestore offers **real-time updates**, scalable NoSQL structure, and is easy to query and sync with Flutter apps. |
| **Firebase Hosting** | To deploy the web app globally | Hosting is **fast, reliable**, and integrates seamlessly with Firebase services and Flutter build outputs. |
| **Dart** | Programming language used by Flutter | Dart is **optimized for UI**, has a simple syntax, and provides fast compilation to JavaScript for the web. |
